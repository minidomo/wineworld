## WineWorld: Project Proposal

Our WineWorld website allows users to explore the fascinating world of wine, vineyards, and wine regions. With a focus on promoting civic engagement, our website provides an in-depth look at the wine industry, making it an essential resource for anyone who is interested in wine, whether they're a beginner, intermediate, or seasoned wine connoisseur. WineWorld provides a wealth of information about different wines, vineyards, and wine regions, empowering users to make informed decisions about which wines to try, where to go to taste them, and what they can expect from each wine. WineWorld is an essential resource for anyone who is looking to deepen their understanding of the wine industry, and it's a great way for wine enthusiasts to connect with others who share their passion for wine.

## Questions

1. What are the different types of wine?
2. What are some popular vineyards in a specific wine region?
3. I'm taking a trip soon, and I love wine. How can I compare different wine regions to find the best travel destination for me?
